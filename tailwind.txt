# Working with Tailwind CSS v4

Tailwind v4 is CSS-native. No tailwind.config.js. The root tailwind.css drives everything.

First line in tailwind.css: @import "tailwindcss";
This injects Preflight reset, theme variables, and the engine that emits only classes you use.

Preflight changes to know
- Headings lose default margins and sizes; add classes like text-3xl font-bold.
- Lists lose bullets and indent; add list-disc ml-4.
- Box sizing becomes border-box. Images are block and max-width: 100%.

HubSpot specifics
- The Page Editor injects its own CSS; always check the live preview.
- The reset affects legacy modules; add explicit utilities so they stay correct.
- CSS order: Base reset, then your custom CSS, then utilities that win last.

How it works
- Source: tailwind.css. Output: src/theme/my-minimal-theme/css/main.css.
- Scanner keeps only classes used in your HubL, HTML, or JS.

Customizing
- Use an @theme block in tailwind.css for variables such as colors, fonts, spacing.
- Example: --color-brand-primary, --font-sans, --spacing-128.
- These become normal CSS variables like var(--color-brand-primary).

Dev loop
- Keep npm run dev running.
- Edit HubL and add classes (bg-brand-primary text-white); main.css updates automatically.
- See changes on localhost:3000

Rules to keep things healthy
- Do not edit src/.../css/main.css directly; change the @theme block instead.
- Do not add tailwind.config.js.
- Keep npm run dev running while coding.
- Use utility classes instead of inline style blocks.

Why Tailwind here
- Ships only used CSS for performance.
- Consistent spacing and colors through utilities.
- Modern local dev workflow for HubSpot.
